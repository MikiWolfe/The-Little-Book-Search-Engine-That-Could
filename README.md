## Description:

A book search that lets users save books that they wish to buy and read at a later time. They can remove books once they have finished reading them. We have been given the task of converting the site from restful API to qraphQL. We have set up a database using MongoDB were we can save our users data.

### Things I learned from this assignment:

It can be very challenging to refractor code from a restful API to a completely different database structure. I found this assignment very challenging.
